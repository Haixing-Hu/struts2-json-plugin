# struts2-json-plugin

This is a refactor of the official Apache Struts2 JSON plugin. It was based on the code forked from https://github.com/apache/struts .

The reason to refactor the plugin, is that the original plugin has a lot of bugs and flaws, which cannot fulfill the requirement of my project. The official project has not been actively maintained for a long time, so I decide to maintain it by myself.
